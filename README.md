# Instructions:
Press `D` to solve the problem with a DFS algorithm.
You can press `K` to delete 10 random numbers from the grid.
You can press `B` to use BFS to solve the problem. It is recommended to use it only after solving the board with DFS and deleting 10-20 items, since BFS is famously slow at solving Sudoku boards.
Press `R` to reset the board to the original configuration.
